    story = "Hello comrade. My name is Private Vladimir. I am writing these logs as we go eastward toward Hawaii. The crew's spirits are high. Captain Chetnakov is as strict as usual, he made us scrub the floors of the airlock with a toothbrush last week. Captain Chetnakov never goes anywhere without his pocket watch, and he always uses it to show how inefficient we are. Yesterday, the captain made Sergei burn all the photos of his wife after falling asleep during the night shift. Needless to say, Sergei was enraged. Demetri has been mumbling in his sleep again, Ivan is quiet as always, and Sergei is as boisterous and disagreeable as can be. The submarine carries onward. We just intercepted a message from an island nearby. Captain Chetnakov said we should follow it, as it may be a secret base for the Americans. Most of us on the crew did not want to follow it as we were tired of voyaging and wanted to join the beaches of California. However, Ivan was unusually adamant of investigating the message. Ivan convinced Captain Chetnakov and told him it was a matter of life or death. We stopped at a small island east of Hawaii. Surfacing was hard work since Demetri was scared of the airlock. We searched the island for about an hour and found nothing of interest. Sergei kept badmouthing Captain Chetnakov as we walked. “That captain is gonna get us killed, sending us on wild goose chases,” Sergei said. Ivan did not speak out, mumbling to himself about how it didn't matter anyways. On our trek through the island, Demetri screamed and grabbed his leg. Demetri had been bitten by some kind of marsh fish. Demetri went off on his own to walk off the pain. We went back through the airlock and continued onward toward the California coast. Our goal is to be ready just off the shoreline and wait for the all-clear from the Soviet base to attack. We are three weeks away from the California shores. Ever since the island, Demetri has been acting strange. I think Demetri misses home. Ivan has been isolating himself from the rest of the crew. Last night, the communications panel went off as though someone had been using it. I think Ivan has been communicating with someone off the ship. I don't know why I'm still writing this. The submarine is in disarray. We woke up today and Captain Chetnakov is nowhere to be found. We're 20,000 leagues under the ocean, if Chetnakov is missing, it means he's been murdered. I've gathered all of the crew, Demetri, Ivan, and Sergei into the central chamber. No one can leave until we figure out who murdered Captain Chetnakov. I can't trust any of them, the only person I know who couldn't have done this is me. Demetri is more anxious than ever. Demetri keeps crying that he'll be next. Sergei tried to calm Demetri down with a “Shut up you buffoon.” I interrogated where each of them was that night. I don't remember Demetri muttering in his sleep that night, but he said that he couldn't get comfortable and slept in a different room. Sergei's snoring droned on the whole night in the crew's quarters, so it probably couldn't have been him. Suspiciously, no one saw Ivan for most of the night. Ivan had no explanation for his absence, but I'm worried he is a suspect since he may have been the one to use the communications. We spent another night holed up in the central chamber, trying to figure out who murdered Captain Chetnakov. I went back through the ship's internal maintenance records and found that the airlock was opened on the night of the captain's disappearance. That means the captain must have been sent out through the airlock and to his death. Ivan spoke up today and decided he should come clean. Ivan revealed that he was the one to use the communications panel just a few nights before Captain Chetnakov was killed. “I'm a spy for the Americans”, Ivan said bluntly. Ivan continued, “I thought since we're all on the brink of death, I might as well come clean to prove my innocence”. Sergei punched Ivan with unbelievable force, but Demetri pulled them off of each other with a strength I had never seen in him before. Demetri began to cry again about Ivan's admission. Demetri screamed, perhaps in a fit of paranoia, “YOU'RE THE SPY. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED CAPTAIN CHETNAKOV!” But, Ivan explained that he would never, as that would draw too much suspicion to himself. His mission was to send back info about the pacific attack, he couldn't compromise that by killing a superior. I decided it would be better if we all went back to sleep in the crew's quarters. The days go by with tension in the air. The rations are getting thin, Demetri can't stop crying and he's making strange noises in the night. Sergei, however, seemed to be doing better than ever. The murder of the captain did not phase him at all. After opening up, Ivan has become far more friendly. It makes me wonder who could have possibly killed Captain Chetnakov."
